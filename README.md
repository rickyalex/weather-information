# weather-information

A dead-simple weather information app, using the API of https://openweathermap.org/
Simply make a GET request to the app port to retrieve the information in JSON format

http://{host_address}:{host_port}/api/v1/weather/{city_name}

Example :

http://localhost:3000/api/v1/weather/jakarta

Note : To try this app, please send me a request, later I will send you the config.js required for the app to run which I can't publicly share because it contains the API key
